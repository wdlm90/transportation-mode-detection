It is the transportation log and parser of the following paper: http://infolab.stanford.edu/~echang/BigDataSmallFootprint-VLDB-2014.pdf. Ten transportation modes are collected in Taiwan, including still, walk, run, bicycle, motorcycle, car, bus, metro, train, and high speed rail(HSR).

We migrate it from HTC's computing infrastructure, then every one can use and run it. Please notice this open source project is still in a Beta version.

We released the extracted feature files in git repository, you can clone the project to get them. If you would like to get the raw log files, please contact us and leave your name, affiliation, and the purpose in the mail.

If you wish to publish any work used this log, please cite our paper as: Meng-Chieh Yu, Tong Yu, Shao-Chen Wang, Chih-Jen Lin, and Edward Chang, Big Data Small Footprint: The Design of A Low-Power Classifier for Detecting Transportation Modes.
